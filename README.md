# ** What is this?
This repository contains some traditional machine learning algorithms. All algorithms were implemented
from scratch without using machine learning libraries

## [Linear regression](https://github.com/vanloc19bk96/simple_ML_algorithms/blob/master/linear_regression.py) ##

 I used the simple dataset. You can download on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/karthickveerakumar/salary-data-simple-linear-regression)
 If you apply your dataset in this algorithm which hasn't a good result. Please change learning rate or iterations until a good result.
